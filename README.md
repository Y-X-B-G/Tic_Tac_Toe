## General Information
This project is created for the Spring 2025 CP468 group project. It is an interactive implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe where the user has the option to play against a Minimax Algorithm AI
or to spectate a game between the Minimax AI and a Gemini AI. It hosts a multi-agent environment to explore decision-making in a competitive setting.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.11.5


## Setup
 To run Tic-Tac-Toe, open the repository in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code and create a ".env" file. In this file, type "GOOGLE_API_KEY=XXXXX", replacing the "XXXXX" with a Gemini API key. Before executing the program, ensure you have ran the line "pip install google.generativeai" in terminal to install the necessary libraries to run the Gemini AI.


## Execution
Once setup is complete, open gui.py and run the program. This should open a new tab with the Tic-Tac-Toe interface that is ready to play.
